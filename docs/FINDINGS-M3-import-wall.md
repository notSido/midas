# M3 groundwork finding: the pre-OEP import-resolution wall

Status: **observation, reproducible**. Interpretations below are labelled; items
marked *hypothesis* are not yet proven and must be confirmed before code relies
on them.

## How to reproduce

```
cargo build --release --example probe_sample
./target/release/examples/probe_sample samples/<sample>.exe <instruction-cap>
```

The probe parses the PE (`pe` layer), maps the full image into the Unicorn
harness (`emu::Emu::map_image`), sets RIP to the PE entry point, and runs with
`emu::Emu::run_observed`, which records instruction count, a bounded ring buffer
of recent RIPs, a register snapshot, and the first unmapped/again-faulting
memory access. The example disassembles the recent (decrypted) instruction
stream out of guest memory with `iced-x86` and dumps register-pointed memory.

The samples are gitignored; see `samples/SAMPLES.md`. This finding is a captured
CLI artifact, not a committed test (the run is long and sample-dependent).

## Observation (both samples, Themida 3.2.4.34 demo)

Run from the PE entry point, both samples execute a long self-contained
decryption/decompression phase with **no dependency on the emulated environment**
(no unmapped data reads, no API calls) and then transfer control to an unmapped
address:

| | `test_target_protected.exe` | `test_target2_protected.exe` |
|---|---|---|
| Entry VA | `0x14030b058` | `0x14033d058` |
| Instructions until the wall | 26,519,612 | 28,228,274 |
| Fault | fetch-unmapped `0x000000000004d00d` | fetch-unmapped `0x000000000004d00d` |
| Transfer site (`.themida` RVA) | `+0x5cb7c` | `+0x4f884` |
| `RAX`/`RCX` at fault point to | ASCII `"kernel32.dll\0"` | ASCII `"kernel32.dll\0"` |
| `RBX` at fault | `0x4d080` | `0x4d080` |

The last decrypted instructions before the fault are identical in structure in
both samples — a full context-restore trampoline:

```
  pop r8 ; pop r9 ; pop r10 ; pop r11 ; pop r12 ; pop r13 ; pop r14 ; pop r15
  pop rdi ; pop rsi ; pop rbp ; pop rbx ; pop rdx ; pop rcx ; pop rax
  popf
  ret 0
```

i.e. the loader restores a saved register context (`popf` + pop of all GPRs) and
`ret`s. The `ret` pops a target address off the stack and jumps to it; that
target is `0x4d00d`, which is not mapped, so emulation stops.

## What is shared vs per-instance

- **Shared (loader structure):** the trampoline shape, the fault target
  `0x4d00d`, `RBX = 0x4d080`, and the fact that `RAX`/`RCX` reference the string
  `"kernel32.dll"`. These are properties of the Themida 3.2.4.34 loader, not of
  either payload — they match across two independently-protected binaries.
- **Per-instance:** the transfer-site RVA (`+0x5cb7c` vs `+0x4f884`), the string
  pointer address (`0x1400cc25b` vs `0x1400fc71a`), the instruction count to
  reach the wall, and the exact stack contents.

The shared constants (`0x4d00d`, `0x4d080`) are **not** to be hardcoded as
sample constants; they are recorded here only as evidence that the mechanism is
uniform. Any address midas acts on must be derived at runtime.

## Interpretation

The loader has finished unpacking its own code and has reached its **Windows-API
resolution stage**: it holds a pointer to `"kernel32.dll"` and invokes an API
through its obfuscated context-restore `ret` trampoline. Because midas provides
no Windows loader environment (the mapped PEB/TEB are zeroed, no module list, no
resolved import thunks, no API implementations), the call target the loader
expected to be a real function address is instead an unresolved value
(`0x4d00d`), and the jump faults.

This refines the charter's "unresolved imports" appendix note: the blocker bites
**pre-OEP**, at the loader's own kernel32 resolution, well before the ~195M-
instruction OEP estimate.

*Hypothesis (not yet proven):* the loader resolves kernel32 exports by name/hash
after obtaining the module base, so getting past the wall requires (a) a module
list reachable from the PEB such that the loader's `GetModuleHandle`/`LoadLibrary`
path yields a kernel32 base, (b) an export-resolution path (`GetProcAddress` by
name and/or hash) returning callable addresses, and (c) API stubs behind those
addresses that emulate the effect. The precise resolution path (PEB->Ldr walk vs
a Themida-internal table, name vs hash) is **not yet confirmed** and must be
determined by further tracing before the win64 layer is designed around it.

## What this justifies building next (win64 layer, M3 proper)

Driven by the above and confirmed on both samples, the next work is a minimal
Windows-64 environment: a PEB/TEB with a module list containing at least the
modules the loader looks up, an export/`GetProcAddress` mechanism, and API stubs
added **only** as the loader is observed to call them — each with a test
asserting its emulated effect, and each validated against **both** samples.
